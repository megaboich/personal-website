## Lyrics

Tall and tan and young and lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes

Each one she passes goes "ah"

--- 

When she walks, she's like a samba

That swings so cool and sways so gentle

That when she passes

Each one she passes goes "ooh"

--- 

But I watch her so sadly

How can I tell her I love her

Yes, I would give my heart gladly

But each day, when she walks to the sea

She looks straight ahead, not at me

--- 

Tall and tan and young and lovely

The girl from Ipanema goes walking

And when she passes

I smile but she doesn't see, doesn't see
