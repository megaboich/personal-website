## Lyrics

<awesome-auto-scroller duration="2.6"></awesome-auto-scroller>

You'll remember me

When the west wind moves

Upon the fields of barley

You'll forget the sun 

In his jealous sky

As we walk in fields of gold

--- 

So she took her love

For to gaze a while

Upon the fields of barley

In his arms she fell 

As her hair came down

Among the fields of gold

--- 

Will you stay with me?

Will you be my love?

Upon the fields of barley

We'll forget the sun 

In his jealous sky

As we lie in fields of gold

--- 

See the west wind move 

Like a lover so

Upon the fields of barley

Feel her body rise 

When you kiss her mouth

Among the fields of gold

--- 

I never made promises lightly

And there have been some that I've broken

But I swear in the days still left

We'll walk in fields of gold

We'll walk in fields of gold

--- 

Many years have passed 

Since those summer days

Among the fields of barley

See the children run 

As the sun goes down

Among the fields of gold

--- 

You'll remember me 

When the west wind moves

Upon the fields of barley

You can tell the sun 

In his jealous sky

When we walked in fields of gold

When we walked in fields of gold

When we walked in fields of gold
