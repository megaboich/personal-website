#### Verse 1
 
`Am                   Em`

New blood joins this earth

`    D                Am`

And quickly heʼs sub-dued.

`        Am               Em`

Through constant pain disgrace

`    D                      Am`

The young boy learns their rules.
 
`     Am                   Em`

With time the child draws in

`     D                 Am`

This whipping boy done wrong.

`  Am                Em`

Deprived of all his thoughts

`    D                   Am`

The young man struggles on and on, heʼs known
 
`      C        G`

A vow unto his own

`    Am`

That never from this day

`   C                  G Em`

His will theyʼll take away

---
##### Chorus

`Am        C               G`

What Iʼve felt, what Iʼve known

`      Em                          Am`

Never shined through in what Iʼve shown.

`      C         G`

Never be. Never see.

`      E                   Am`

Wonʼt see what might have been.
  
`          C               G`

What Iʼve felt, what Iʼve known

`      Em                          Am`

Never shined through in what Iʼve shown.

`      C           G`

Never free. Never me.

`    E            Am`

So I dub the unforgiven.

---
##### Verse 2

`     Am             Em`
They dedicate their lives

`   D              Am`

To running all of his

`   Am                   Em`

He tries to please them all

`     D             Am`

This bitter man he is
 
`     Am                 Em`

Throughout the life the same

`     D               Am`

Heʼs battled constantly

`     Am              Em`

This fight he cannot win.

`  D              Am`

A tired man they see no longer cares.
 
`    C            G`

The old man then prepares

`   Am`

To die regretfully

`     C               G Em`

That old man here is me.

---
##### Chorus

`Am        C               G`

What Iʼve felt, what Iʼve known

`      Em                          Am`

Never shined through in what Iʼve shown.

`      C         G`

Never be. Never see.

`      E                   Am`

Wonʼt see what might have been.
  
`          C               G`

What Iʼve felt, what Iʼve known

`      Em                          Am`

Never shined through in what Iʼve shown.

`      C           G`

Never free. Never me.

`    E            Am`

So I dub the unforgiven.
