### Lyrics

He deals the cards as a meditation

And those he plays never suspect

He doesn't play for the money he wins

He don't play for respect

--- 

He deals the cards to find the answer

The sacred geometry of chance

The hidden law of a probable outcome

The numbers lead a dance

---

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier

I know that the clubs are weapons of war

I know that diamonds mean money for this art

But that's not the shape of my heart

---

He may play the jack of diamonds

He may lay the queen of spades

He may conceal a king in his hand

While the memory of it fades

---

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier

I know that the clubs are weapons of war

I know that diamonds mean money for this art

But that's not the shape of my heart

---

That's not the shape

The shape of my heart

If I told her that I loved you

You'd maybe think there's something wrong

---

I'm not a man of too many faces

The mask I wear is one

But those who speak know nothing

And find out to their cost

---

Like those who curse their luck in too many places

And those who fear are lost

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier

I know that the clubs are weapons of war

I know that diamonds mean money for this art

But that's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape

The shape of my heart
