## Lyrics

So close, no matter how far

Couldn't be much more from the heart

Forever trusting who we are

And nothing else matters

---

Never opened myself this way

Life is ours, we live it our way

All these words, I don't just say

And nothing else matters

---

Trust I seek and I find in you

Every day for us something new

Open mind for a different view

And nothing else matters

---

Never cared for what they do

Never cared for what they know

But I know

---

So close, no matter how far

It couldn't be much more from the heart

Forever trusting who we are

And nothing else matters

---

Never cared for what they do

Never cared for what they know

But I know

---

I never opened myself this way

Life is ours, we live it our way

All these words, I don't just say

And nothing else matters

---

Trust I seek and I find in you

Every day for us something new

Open mind for a different view

And nothing else matters

---

Never cared for what they say

Never cared for games they play

Never cared for what they do

Never cared for what they know

And I know, yeah, yeah

---

So close, no matter how far

Couldn't be much more from the heart

Forever trusting who we are

No, nothing else matters
