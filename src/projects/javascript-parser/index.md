[JavaScript map parser](https://github.com/megaboich/js-map-parser) is an extension for Visual Studio and Notepad++ to show panel with hierarchy structure of your JavaScript file. I created this tool to improve navigation over monstrous spaghetti-styled legacy JavaScript codebase. 

Now this extension is mostly obsolete unless you are stuck in previous era and still working with ES5.
