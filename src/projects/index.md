This is a (short) list of projects that I do like to spend my free time on.

* [Logo playground](https://github.com/logolang/logo-playground) is an online IDE for LOGO programming language with ability to write and execute programs directly in web browser. LOGO was my first programming language which I learned when I was 10 years old, so I decided to create some decent own-made environment to fullfill my nostalgia and have sone fun during the process. 

* **Obsolete** [JavaScript map parser](https://github.com/megaboich/js-map-parser) is an extension for Visual Studio and Notepad++ to show panel with hierarchy structure of your JavaScript file. I created this tool to improve navigation over monstrous spaghetti-styled legacy JavaScript codebase.
