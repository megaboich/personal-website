My name is Oleksandr Boiko, welcome to my website.

My main occupation is software development. I do this professionally for a living since 2005 and so far I pretty much like what I am doing.

A little bit about myself.
I was born in [Kharkiv, Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv), and lived there till 2015. Then I grasped an opportunity and moved to The Netherlands to pursue my professional and personal ambitions. Currently, I am enjoying my life in the suburbs of Amsterdam in a company with my wife, kids, and a quite smart cat.

I like playing the guitar from time to time and prefer to keep my favorite repertoire [lyrics, tabs, and chords](/songs) handy in one place.

Sometimes I have some free time and an urgent desire to code something different or unusual. I like to do experiments and learn new stuff. Occasionally it happens that a small experiment evolves into a [project or demo](/projects/). A long time ago I wrote some posts in a [dev blog](/posts) which now is mostly irrelevant.
