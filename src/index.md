My name is Oleksandr Boiko and this is my website.

My main occupation is software development, I do this professionally for my living since 2005 and so far I pretty like what I am doing.

I lived in [Kharkiv, Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv) till 2015 and then I moved to [Amsterdam area, The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randstad).

I have a beautiful wife, wonderful children, and a very smart tuxedo cat.

I enjoy playing the guitar from time to time and prefer to keep [lyrics and chords](/chords) handy in one place.

Sometimes I have some free time and an urgent desire to code something different or unusual. I like to do experiments and learn new stuff. Occasionally it happens that small experiment evolves into a project.

When I do have something to share I try to write an article in my [blog](/posts/).
