Welcome to my personal website/blog! It contains some technology and programming stuff and experiments, which I would like to share. Here are not so much of really cool stuff, but I still do have a chance to fix that.

I do some Open Source [projects](/projects) when I am bored. 

I keep my [résumé](/resume) up to date for no reason. 

Also I like sci-fi books, computer games, guitar, movies, different kinds of music, cycling, swimming and life in general.
