My name is Oleksandr Boiko and this is my personal website.

I lived in [Kharkiv, Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv) till 2015 and then I moved to [Amsterdam area, The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randstad).

I have a beautiful wife, a quite active son and a daughter and a very smart tuxedo cat.

My main occupation is a software development, I do this professionally for my living since 2005 and so far I pretty like what I am doing.

Sometimes I have some free time and urgent desire to code something different or unusual. I really like to do experiments and learn new stuff. Occasionally it happens that small experiment evolves into a project.

When I do have something to share I try to write an article in my [blog](/posts/).
